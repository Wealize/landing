        <p>
          Wealize (formally The Neon Project) was awarded a CDTI grant in one of
          its most important programmes in 2019: NEOTEC, an initiative to
          support the creation and consolidation of technology-based companies.
          This has meant the validation and support of the R&D work in one of
          the projects being developed by the company: Metaledger.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Wealize, we help organisations to overcome challenges through
          technology. That is why we develop digital products based on
          blockchain, cognitive services and conversational agents. In this
          sense, Metaledger is a traceability solution for gold and other
          high-value metals that are mined in difficult environments.
