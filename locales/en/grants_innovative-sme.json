At Wealize (formally The Neon Project), we are committed to the development of digital products that enable us to overcome challenges through technology, and we believe that innovation is one of the most important paths to growth.",
    "second_paragraph": "For all these reasons, this recognition adds an extra dimension to the R&D we have been developing. It also encourages us to go even deeper into the areas of greatest technological interest from the point of view of innovation: digital identity and other solutions based on blockchain; the development of conversational agents as a method of communication and business support; and the use of tools based on cognitive services that allow complex problems to be solved."
